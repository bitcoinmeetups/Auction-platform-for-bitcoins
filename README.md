Buy bitcoins for other crypto currencies and vice versa

What is it? 

It's a platform where you can buy and sell Bitcoins in exchange for Litecoins, Devcoins, Namecoins and whatnot.

Why do we need it?

Digital currencies need exchanges.

How can we get it?

We can get this platform by creating it ourselves.

How can we distribute it?

The source code will be available at GitHub.com/entrances

Why are you doing this?

I am doing this because I like open source and I'm ok with writing down and sharing my ideas here. Would like it even more if I could make an income out of it.

Is this a good idea?

Yes, I think so. If you don't think it's a good idea, feel free to comment.
